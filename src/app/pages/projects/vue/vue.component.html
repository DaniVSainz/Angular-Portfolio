                      <h5 class="cadetblue">About</h5>
                      <p>
                          This website came about while I was looking for a project that I could feel passionate about to showcase some of my skills.
                          I didn't ever expect it to end up being as complicated as it was but I felt like I had to go
                          through with it since I started. I had to research multiple cryptocurrency exchange websites
                          and go through their API's to get a general idea of what the data I would be scraping
                      </p>

                      <ul>
                          <li>Backend was written in Ruby on Rails then once more In Node+Express as I wanted to maintain my
                              skills in both languages.</li>
                          <li>Connects to multiple api's with cron jobs triggering functions scraping data for approx 1560
                              crypto currencies</li>
                          <li>Databases: Ruby version: PostgreSQL, Node/Express version: MongoDB</li>
                      </ul>
                      <h5 class="cadetblue">Challenges</h5>
                      <p>
                          One of the bigger challenges was the database design since I knew all of the different cryptocurrency exchange website API's
                          I had in mind would not have consistent data across the board. </p>
                      <div class="flex-it">
                          <img src="assets/images/cryptonalysis/db-design.PNG" class="img-fluid des-img" alt="">
                      </div>
                      <p>
                          While many of these connections went unused, I sat down and thought of all the possible scenarios I could run into long-term
                          if I never stopped developing the site.I didn't want to write a ton of code for my automatic
                          jobs to later find that I had to change the database and code significantly
                      </p>
                      <h5 class="cadetblue">Second problem</h5>
                      <p>
                          The second problem I ran into was that I wanted the data to be scraped consistently, more specifically every 5 minutes.I
                          also knew that for the node backend version this would completely block requests a large portion
                          of the time it was running.When running the scripts for the first time on a fresh database it seeds
                          over 47,000 days of data while going through 300 endpoints.
                          <br>
                          I looked at a lot of
                          packages and quickly found that I was overcomplicating something that could be very simple so
                          I decided to just use cron to schedule forked node processes that ran the scripts.
                          <br>
                          For ruby,
                          I used whenever a Ruby gem that provides a clear syntax for writing and deploying
                          cron jobs. 
                      </p>
