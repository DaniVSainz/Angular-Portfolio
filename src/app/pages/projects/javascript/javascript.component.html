                        <h5 class="cadetblue">About</h5>
                        <p>
                            This website came about while I was looking for a project that I could feel passionate about to showcase some of my skills.
                            I didn't ever expect it to end up being as complicated as it was but I felt like I had to go
                            through with it since I started. I had to research multiple cryptocurrency exchange websites
                            and go through their API's to get a general idea of what the data I would be scraping
                        </p>

                            <li>Backend was written in Ruby on Rails then once more In Node+Express as I wanted to maintain my
                                skills in both languages.</li>

                        </ul>
                        <h5 class="cadetblue">Challenges</h5>
                        <p>
                            One of the bigger challenges was the database design since I knew all of the different cryptocurrency exchange website API's
                            I had in mind would not have consistent data across the board. </p>
                        <div class="flex-it">
                            <img id="schemaImg" src="assets/images/cryptonalysis/db-design.PNG" class="img-fluid des-img" alt="">
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            While many of these connections went unused, I sat down and thought of all the possible scenarios I could run into long-term
                            if I never stopped developing the site.I didn't want to write a ton of code for my automatic
                            jobs to later find that I had to change the database and code significantly
                        </p>
                        <h5 class="cadetblue">Second problem</h5>
                        <p>
                            The second problem I ran into was that I wanted the data to be scraped consistently, more specifically every 5 minutes.I
                            also knew that for the node backend version this would completely block requests a large portion
                            of the time it was running.When running the scripts for the first time on a fresh database it seeds
                            over 47,000 days of data while going through 300 endpoints.
                            <br>
                            I looked at a lot of
                            packages and quickly found that I was overcomplicating something that could be very simple so
                            I decided to just use cron to schedule forked node processes that ran the scripts.
                            <br>
                            For ruby,
                            I used whenever a Ruby gem that provides a clear syntax for writing and deploying
                            cron jobs.

                        <p>
                            At a certain point, I realized the repetition there was on every new website I ever made, Authentication.I would go into
                            old projects and start copy pasting for a few hours until I glued together something reminiscent
                            of my old projects.It was frustrating, dirty and i'd have to go through the project removing
                            CSS classes hoping i wouldnt miss anything.
                            <br> I had enough, so I decided to make my own template with the least amount of unneeded dependencies
                            as I could come up with.It had to be robust if I was going to be cloning it, and minimal CSS
                            as I may not want to use bootstrap or material or w.e framework is in flavor that month anymore.
