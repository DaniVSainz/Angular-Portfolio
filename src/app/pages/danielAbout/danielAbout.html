                    As you can Imagine by now my name is Daniel, but most people call me Dani.Programming caught my eye at a very young age 
                    when i found bots for online games.The fact you could program things to do work for you, and the challenge of making them more efficient
                    was something i found myself drawn to it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A few years later I decided I wanted to make programming my career and the center piece to my life.I began by learning python on my own
                    through websites and shortly after joined a coding Bootcamp to immerse myself in a enviroment where everyone had the same goal of learning
                    as much as possible in 3 short months.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During my 3 months at Wyncode i learned the fundamentals of object oriented programming while using Ruby.I Was introduced
                    to MVC centered web developement using the ruby on rails framework.Database management with Sqlite,MySql and PostgreSQL.As well as 
                    project management methodologies such as Kanban,Scrum,Agile etc and had daily standups and weekly retros.
