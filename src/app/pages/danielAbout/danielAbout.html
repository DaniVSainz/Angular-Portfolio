                    As you can Imagine by now my name is Daniel, but most people call me Dani.Programming caught my eye at a very young age 
                    when i found bots for online games.The fact you could program things to do work for you, and the challenge of making them more efficient
                    was something i found myself drawn to it.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    A few years later I decided I wanted to make programming my career and the center piece to my life.I began by learning python on my own
                    through websites and shortly after joined a coding Bootcamp to immerse myself in a enviroment where everyone had the same goal of learning
                    as much as possible in 3 short months.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Shortly after i left wyncode in march 2017, I became aware of the vast sea of techonologies.I wanted to try them all but I knew I couldn't
                    due to time so i decided to start with more modern frameworks and added Angular + Node/Mean Stack to my skills.But my curiosity never ended
                    which led me to making bots in Java with Selenium for some not so usual uses like mass botting Github and making myself the most trending developer
                    in the world for 24hrs, and some more normal cases like testing and web scraping.                    
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    But there's always some shiny new toy out there, which snowballed me into making small projects with React, Solidity to make Ethereum smart contracts,some
                    very basic games in Unity & Unreal Engine using visual scripting, and the most curious one being Artificial neural networks in Python.

                <p>
                    Its been a long year and I'm excited to see where this leads me 5 years down the road.You can check out some of the projects 
                    I made with some of the things mentioned above or my actual skills set down below
                </p>

                    Thanks,<br>
