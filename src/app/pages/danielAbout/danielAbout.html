            As you can Imagine by now my name is Daniel, but most people call me Dani.Programming caught my eye at a very young age 
            when i found bots for online games.The fact you could program things to do work for you, and the challenge of making them more efficient
            was something i found myself drawn to it.

            A few years later I decided I wanted to make programming my career and the center piece to my life.I began by learning python on my own
            through websites and shortly after joined a coding Bootcamp to immerse myself in a enviroment where everyone had the same goal of learning
            as much as possible in 3 short months.I've since finished the bootcamp and continue expanding my toolbelt coding on weekends.

            Currently I've been working as a intern at Royal Carribean for the last three months and it has been a great learning experience.
